/**
 **In this exercise we will work with our first if-statement. In the code below we declare a variable num with a value 0. Then, we have an if-statement. The if-statement consists of a condition – the part inside the parentheses – and some code inside a pair of curly braces. The code will assign the variable num a new value 1. But it will only run if the condition is met.
 **Adjust the condition such that the code inside the curly braces will execute and the console.log() statement logs true.

let num = 0;
if (1 < 2) {
  num = 1;

console.log(num === 1);
